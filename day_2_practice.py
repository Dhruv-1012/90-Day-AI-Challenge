# This for single character
# print("",s[1])                   #012345678910 this is forward indexing
# print("",s[8])                   -11-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 this is reverse indexing
# print("",s[100])  # give error and say string index is out of range

# print("",s[-20])  

#This is for sub string or multiple characters

# print("",s[0:5])        # it start from 0 and go to 5 and it does not consider the end point like it will print 0 to 4 not 
# print("",s[6:10])           
# print("",s[0:10:2])     # it mean start from 0 till 10 and jump or skip 2 like 0+2 2 then 2+2 4 ....
# print("",s[0:100:2])    
# print("",s[0:10:-1])    # when ever ther is direction  confleit the output is blank
