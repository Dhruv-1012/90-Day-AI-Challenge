# LECTURE 2
#  Here we use type it is a defult funcation that help us to identify what type of value is variable is holding whather it was int or float 
# a = 2
# print("the value of a is ",a)
# print("type ",type (a))
# b = 45.433
# print("the value of b is ", b)
# print("type is ",type(b)) 

# Here we see that python will print the latest value of a variable or print latest declariation of a variable
# It have auto garbage collection call and delete the old data to free space 
#  a = 2
# b = 45.433
# print("the value of b is ", b)
# print("type is ",type(b)) 
# a = 10
# print("the value of a is ",a)
# print("type ",type (a))

# And here we see that it print the latest one even the type is change from int to float 
# a = 2
# b = 45.433
# print("the value of b is ", b)
# print("type is ",type(b)) 
# a = 10
# a = 342.33425
# print("the value of a is ",a)
# print("type ",type (a))

#Now for string and it do not matter that you use ' ' or " "
# s = "dhruv"
# print("",s)
# a = 'my class is 12th'
# print("",a)
# print("",type(s),type(a))

# boolian type
# b = True    # True internal meaning is 1
# print("",type(b))
# c = False  # False internal meaning is 0
# print("",type(c))
# print("",b-c)
# a = 100
# print("answer is ",a+b)
# print("answer is",b*c)
# h = 7 + 8j     # In python or in programing language we use j to denot is as a complex number or imagenary
# print("h",type(h))
# i = 6j
# print("i",type(i))
# print("",h)
# print("",h.imag)
# print("",h.real)

# s = 'dhruv'
# print("",type(s))
# s1 = "hello world"
# print("",type(s1))
# len(s)      # len is a function that tell you the length of the string and it count the characters as well as space like dhru v there are 6 characters including space 
# print("",len(s))
# print("",len(s1))

# print("",s.find('h'))   # here it mean that in variable s using the inbuld funcation called find ('h') and typer the character be need to find
# print("",s.find('H'))       # if data is not available the it return -1
# print("",s1.find('o'))      # here it will print the first match or print the lowest index find it will print that and not check further
# print("",s1.find('or'))
# print("",s1.count('l'))     # it will tell you how many time the character is repeating in the string 
# print("",s1.count('o')) 
# print("",s1.count('q')) 

# print("",s1.upper())        # it just convert the whole string in upper case and it did not change the main data it is not permanent
# s3 ='heLLoDhRuv'
# print("",s3.upper())
# print("",s3.lower())        # it just conver  the whole string in lower case and it did not change the main data it is not permanent
# s3 = s3.lower()
# print("",s3)   #and now it is permanent
# print("",s3.swapcase())   # it just swap the character of the string in lower to upper upper to lower 
# print("",s3.title())        # it will make first latter of each and every string capital or in upper case
# print("",s1.title())
# print("",s1.capitalize())       # it just make first letter capital or in upper case not every string
